  'He is in love. He creates meaning, always and everywhere, out of nothing, and it is meaning which thrills him: he is in the crucible of meaning. Every contact, for the lover, raises the question of an answer. The skin is asked to reply. A squeeze of the hand - enormous documentation - a tiny gesture within the palm, a knee which doesnt move away, an arm extended, as if quite naturally, along the back of a sofa and against which the others head gradually comes to rest -this is the paradisiac realm of subtle and clandestine signs: a kind of festival not of the senses but of meaning. (A lovers discourse by Roland Barthes).'
