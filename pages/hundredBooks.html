              >A curated selection of one hundred books to help anyone who is
              learning contemporary art. Most of these books were passed around
              at Art School because they were trendy at the time and others were
              merely stumbled upon. All these books I have read and have
              included because I remember getting something out of it. This
              website was made to help my students.
