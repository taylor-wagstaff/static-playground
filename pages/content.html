      <h1 class="main-headings">Designing for Content, A Case Study:</h1>
      <p class="body-text">Taylor Wagstaff, 25th July, 2024.</p>
      <h2 class="sub-headings">
        The following website is a record of a chosen topic completed throughout
        my course provided by Content Design London. I decided to document my
        work as a handy reminder of the many methods and tools content designers
        can use to make accessible and user-first digital products.
      </h2>
      <p class="body-text">
        For my topic, I choose to explore a potential user problem of finding an
        art studio. I noticed a large gap in the digital space for a single
        place to locate art studios as there were no effective digital solutions
        to be found online. What I did find, however, were many facebook groups,
        some forums and dedicated profiles on Instagram. From my own personal
        experience, it has largely been through word of mouth that I have
        managed to find a suitable studio for my own artistic practice. This
        user problem presented an ideal candidate to explore content design in
        detail as it covers a wide range of user needs and concerns.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-headings">How do users speak?</h2>
      <p class="body-text">
        To find out who my potential users are, I have to understand how my
        users communicate around the topic. This helps to create a mental model
        of our users, or rather, what words our users might initially think of
        around the user problem. One of the main purposes of Content Design is
        to help our users fulfil a need, which could range from ordering a new
        TV, to booking a Hotel for your upcoming holiday. In order to fulfil
        that need, a user normally begins with research on their chosen topic.
        In this instance however, since I am aiming to create a digital
        solution, Google will form as a first initial step in the user journey.
        I have narrowed down from a list of key words which my users may use to
        search for an art studio online. By using Google Trends, I can provide a
        way to track the usage of key words over time. This gives me the most
        commonly used terms regarding my topic.
      </p>
      <p class="body-text">Here are my Key Words:</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Artist Studio</li>
        <li>Art Studio</li>
        <li>Artist Residency</li>
        <li>Artist Workroom</li>
        <li>Creative Workshop</li>
        <li>Creative Studio</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="body-text">Related Terms:</p>
      <p class="body-text">
        By using Google Trends I was able to find out a range of related queries
        users might also search for. Related queries are search terms which
        relate to the initial search topic, most often Google provides these as
        suggestions to improve your search.
