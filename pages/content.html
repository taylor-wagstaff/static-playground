        The following website is a record of a chosen topic completed throughout
        my course provided by Content Design London. I decided to record my work
        as a handy reminder of the many methods and tools content designers can

        For my topic, I choose to explore a potential user problem of finding an
        art studio. I noticed a large gap in the digital space for a single
        place to locate art studios as there were no effective digital solutions
        to be found online. What I did find, however, were many Facebook groups,
        some forums and dedicated profiles on Instagram. From my own experience,
        it has largely been through word of mouth that I have managed to find a
        suitable studio for my needs. This user problem presented an ideal
        candidate to explore content design in detail as it covers a wide range
        of user needs and concerns.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-headings" id="How-do-users-speak?">How Do Users Speak?</h2>
      <p class="body-text">
        To find out who my potential users are, I have to understand how my
        users communicate around the topic. This helps to create a mental model
        of our users, or rather, what words our users might initially think of
        around the user problem. One of the main purposes of Content Design is
        to help our users fulfil a need, which could range from ordering a new
        TV to booking a Hotel for your upcoming holiday. To fulfil that need, a
        user normally begins with research on the chosen topic. In this
        instance, however, since I am aiming to create a digital solution,
        Google will form the first initial step in the user journey. I have
        narrowed down a list of keywords which my users may use to search for an
        art studio online. By using Google Trends, I can provide a way to track
        the usage of keywords over time. This gives me the most commonly used
        terms regarding my topic.

      <p class="body-text">Here are my Key Words:</p>

      <p class="body-text">
        By using Google Trends I was able to find out a range of related queries
        users would also search for. Related queries are search terms which
        relate to the initial search topic, most often Google provides these as
        suggestions to improve your search.

        I have discovered users are concerned with a range of factors in finding
        a studio. Largely, users would like to know if a studio is available for
        rent, close to the user's location, paid by calendar month, what an art
        residency is for (art residencies often provide art studios), and
        specific art studio organisations or programs. From this, I can start to
        create a rough outline of user needs and discover how users might speak
        about my chosen topic.

        Since I have a set of keywords users use to search for regarding my

        vast resource to discover opinions, thoughts, attitudes, beliefs, and
        how people might behave around a given subject. By visiting blogs, news
        websites, forums, and social media posts I can start to create a mental
        model of my users to better understand their concerns around their user

        Most of the news and blog articles are centred around the unaffordable
        nature of the studios in the United Kingdom. Artists are struggling to
        find affordable spaces, however, there are many other initiatives geared
        towards promoting new and available spaces. News articles tend to focus
        on the bleak nature of studio availability, some tend to offer promising
        alternatives, especially the use of more collaborative-based programs of
        art studios and the use of empty commercial space as an opportunity for
        development. In summary, the general attitude is that it is hard to find
        and pay for art studios in the UK, however, there are promising
        solutions on the horizon.
      </p>
      <p class="body-text">
        I managed to locate Facebook groups for art studios in London, of which
        there are a few. Most of the content is available spaces for rent or
        other users looking for spaces. The general attitude is an eagerness for
        available studios, with the occasional complaint on its high price. Some
        of the user's beliefs are a sense of optimism for spaces since they
        desire to find a suitable place to develop their artistic practice.
        However, there was less discussion on these groups, and I wished I could
        locate a suitable forum where discussion on artist studios took place.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-headings">How does this help me?</h2>
      <p class="body-text">
        I largely understood the general sentiment around how my users feel
        about my chosen topic, and how users were willing to voice concerns,
        depending on the digital space it is expressed in. I do realise that
        this is only a generalised view on such attitudes, beliefs and
        behaviours of my audience and ignores a lot of nuance for users who
        might have more diverse or additional needs. I wanted to dig deeper into
        the types of things people desire in studios rather than merely
        complaints about price or unaffordability, which is extremely valid of
        course, however, provides less scope for change due to the lack of
        optimism in some digital spaces.

        The purpose of a user journey is essentially to describe the story or
        narrative that the user follows throughout their core problem. This
        helps me to create a clear problem definition and to iterate diverse
        sets of processes the user may use to fulfil their need. In my case
        study, I'm attempting to understand how users might find an art studio,
        which seems simple enough, however, many users will have diverse
        concerns and approaches to solving their core problem. Lastly, It’s
        important to consider both the user’s offline and online steps
        throughout a user journey, this helps me to consider how I could
        accommodate the user’s transition from offline to online more
        seamlessly.

        As I understand this topic, users might conduct a lot of research to
        find the right studio. Also, there is a wide range of needs and
        specifications for finding a studio space, such as price, location,
        facilities and diverse additional needs which are not often listed on
        studio spaces online. The general process is a long and complicated one
        and would require a lot of work from a user to find a suitable space.
        Most of the work is in the beginning stage for this reason, this is
        where emphasis would need to be placed to make the user experience of
        the content accessible and easy to understand. Through this process, I
        have discovered how many places a user would have to look for studios,
        and that it would be beneficial to the user to locate it all in one
        place.

        From this quick list, I was able to see that there are many diverse
        needs as reflective of both the diversity of art and artists. Before
        this, I was primarily concerned with affordability and availability,
        however, there are many other possible needs the user could be concerned
        with. Making art requires many possible considerations, for example, an
        Oil painter would need good access to light and ventilation, and working
        in a dark space with no ventilation would be damaging to both the body
        and the creative output. User needs have so far been the most revealing
        in uncovering the most around my chosen topic and led me to consider
        other possible user personas. This is not an exhaustive list by no
        means, and I could add hundreds more to the user needs list, however, it
        serves to illustrate the importance of constructing possible scenarios
        for each user's core problem and the range of diversity it may uncover.

        to bridge the gap between the user journey and the user's needs.

      <p class="body-text">
        Through documenting acceptance criteria for just one of my user needs, I
        have discovered that there are many variables for each user and can
        increasingly become more and more detailed. I have noticed another gap
        in understanding the available web solutions for this topic and that
        more options, such as if a studio has good sunlight or ventilation,
        would be beneficial for a user to know. I have realised that studios are
        spaces which ideally reflect the user's needs physically, not just
        simply availability and price. Finally, artists have very diverse sets
        of user needs, and more consideration is needed to help support them on
        their user journey. There are, however, many other aspects of studios I
        hadn't considered, such as having wifi or if it's a shared space.

      <p class="body-text">
        After looking through my user needs, user journeys and acceptance
        criteria I will now be able to create an example listing for my digital
        solution. This listing will be hypothetical and will seek to sketch out
        what content needs to be addressed to satisfy a wide range of user
        needs. What are the types of things a studio needs for an artist to be
        interested? categories such as length, location, facilities and price
        will help our users to determine if it is suitable. Following well-known
        criteria from content design, this listing can serve as a template to
        use in my digital solution. The use of clear headings and subheadings
        will help my users quickly scan the content since our attention span
        online only lasts for an average of eight seconds. Finally, content
        should be easily readable for users, Beth Dunn in her book
        <a

        sums this up perfectly, she states:

      <blockquote>
        <p class="body-text">
          “Font size, color contrast, plain language, adaptability to screen
          readers, and much more all go into designing accessible content. Words
          need to be readable, in the sense that the user needs to be able to
          see and read the letters on the screen; and the text needs to be
          written at a reading level that optimizes comprehension. Text written
          at a sixth- or seventh-grade reading level is generally the most
          easily understood by all users, regardless of education level,
          industry, or background.”

        The title immediately adds the verb of ‘join’ to make clear to the
        reader an action to resolve their core user problem. I also added the
        words ‘studio’ and its location ‘London’ to immediately address possible
        concerns for the user - knowledge of its location and the simple fact it
        is a studio. From this, I decided to break up the content into clear
        distinct categories, such as Price and Location, to make it visibly
        easier to read and could be scanned over quickly. I have also attempted
        to reduce the content most efficiently, making it easy to understand.
        Sentences are reduced in length, rather than lengthy and complex ones,
        and words are substituted for high-frequency words (used most often in
        speech), this helps our reader to follow the text at an easier pace.
        Finally, the general tone of the listing attempts to match the voice of
        my intended audience, as it should be professional, clear and direct in
        delivery. The tone should not be vague or casual, as this would imply a
        degree of untrustworthiness for the user since finding a studio is a
        financial risk and requires investment in time.

      <h1 class="main-headings" id="Digital-Solution">Digital Solution:</h1>

      <p class="body-text">
        Based on my user research, I knew quite quickly that the solution to the
        core problem definition would require a digital search website. From
        understanding user needs, it should contain a range of search options
        for users. This will enable users to search for studios based on their
        unique preferences. It should match in design preexisting websites on
        finding places to rent while focusing on accessibility and common search
        functions. I will use cards to display listings, which is a common
        technique in the tech industry and with various categories based on my
        listing template so that studio providers can enter their studio
        details. User interface design should also resemble common search
        functions so that new users are already familiar with navigating the
        product rather than attempting to create a new user interface design. I
        will attempt to focus on clear visual accessibility so that it is clear
        for partially sighted users. Colours will be kept at a minimum, with an
        emphasis in certain areas to highlight the hierarchy of importance.
        Finally, I will use visual research, wireframes and prototypes to arrive
        at a final digital solution design.

        The websites I have chosen are known for their remarkable effort in
        making their website as accessible as possible. I have noticed there is
        a wide range of shared characteristics between their designs and
        implementation. By researching these websites, I can understand what it
        is visually that makes websites so accessible to the widest range of
        users.
      </p>
      <p class="body-text">Accessible Website Characteristics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Content is presented in a range of diverse formats, such as text,
          video and audio to cater to a wide range of user needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Website is arranged or ‘Operable’ according to Web Content
          Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). That means that the website is
          straightforward in display, menus are laid appropriately, the website
          can be navigated with screen readers and the content is arranged in an
          easy-to-understand design pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
          The content of the website is clear and easy to read. Headings,
          subheadings and text are made bold where appropriate and font size is
          determined by hierarchy of importance. The text is straightforward and
          uses high-frequency words. For example, processes such as forms,
          checkout, button functions, and further information resources are made
          understandable.
        </li>
        <li>
          The visual layout of the website with the use of minimal colours and
          design is laid out in such a way that content is easily scanned over
          for users. Content is easily distinguishable for users, especially for
          those with visual impairments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Images are uniform in size unless made larger to increase importance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accommodates a wide range of screen sizes, and browsers, in addition
          to functionality for screen readers.
        </li>
        <li>
          High readability for users, enhancing their experience of the website.
        </li>
        <li>Alt text is used for images</li>
        <li>Aria labels are used frequently and appropriately.</li>
        <li>
          The layout of the website is uniform and doesn't change drastically
          throughout.
        </li>
        <li>
          Good use of Navigation aids to help users find content more quickly.
        </li>
        <li>Use of keyboard accessibility for users who may use a mouse.</li>
        <li>Accessibility link on the page to highlight features for users.</li>
        <li>Gives more control over the use of content.</li>
        <li>Places users first, at the centre of the design.</li>
        <li>Effective use of line spacing and visually clear button design.</li>
        <li>Demonstrates a commitment to equal access.</li>
        <li>
          Follows Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), such as
          Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.
